# '+=' for variables, this operator adds a value to,
# then sets variable name to new value.
# this formula shortcut can be used with any
# mathmatical operator.

# string example
y = 'one'
y += 'two' # adding to and equaling
print(y)

# int example
x = 1  # x has value of one
x += 2 # same as x = x+2, now x = 3
print(x)
