# As printing A string and A number type like:
# $ print("text" + 3)
# errors as 'cannot concetanate str and int',
# or simply 'cannot add words and numbers',
# we should use the string funtion itself to make
# the number type A string:
print("text " + str(1))
print("text", str(1))
# you can use commas or plus's to put parameters
# on one line, just not with improper types.
